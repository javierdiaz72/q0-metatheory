# Metatheory of 𝓠₀

This repository contains a formalization of the metatheory of 𝓠₀ in Isabelle/HOL.
𝓠₀ is a classical higher-order logic equivalent to Church’s Simple Theory of Types.
In this work, we formalize Chapter 5 of [[1]](#1), up to and including the proofs of soundness and consistency
of 𝓠₀. These proof are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to be formalized in a proof
assistant. The formalization is available at this [AFP entry](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Q0_Metatheory.html).
